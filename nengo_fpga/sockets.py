# TODO better handling of shuffled packets
# If packets get shuffled during transmission, we only keep the first packet
# with a future timestamp and drop all packets with an earlier timestamp if
# they arrive after that packet. Those might still be usable if the current
# simulation time does not exceed the timestamp of those packages. This could
# probably be solved with a priority queue (Python module heapq) to insert
# future packages.

class SocketStep(object):
    r"""Handles the step for socket processes.

    One critical thing in this is to align local and remote timesteps if the
    timestep width (dt) differs. To figure out, the right thing to do we have
    to consider two cases:

    1. Remote dt is smaller or equal than local dt.
    2. Remote dt is larger than local dt.

    But first, some notation: the local timestamp of the current step is
    denoted with :math:`t`, the local timestep width with :math:`dt`. For the
    corresponding remote variable :math:`t'` and :math:`dt'` are used. The
    :math:`t'` is the value read from a remote

    It is also helpful to visualize the timeline with a little diagram:

    .. code-block:: none

          1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    timestep indices
        [ | ][ | ][ | ][ | ][ | ][ | ][ | ][ | ]
        [     |     ][     |     ][     |     ][
              1            2            3         timestep indices

    Each timestep can be represented as an interval ``[ | ]``. The ``|``
    denotes the middle of the interval and corresponds to :math:`t` and
    :math:`t'` respectively. The width of each ``[ | ]`` corresponds to
    :math:`dt` (or :math:`dt'`).

    Let us consider the first case. The bottom row in the diagram denotes the
    local end in this case. Sending packets is simple: we can just send
    a packet in each timestep because the remote end would be able to process
    even more data.

    For receiving packets, we have multiple options as we are potentially
    getting more packets then timesteps. We could average over multiple
    packets, use the packet closest to the timestep interval mean, or use the
    first packet that falls into the local timestep interval. In the code here,
    we are using that last option because it does not require knowledge of the
    timestep between sent packages on the remote end (depending on the
    implementation it might just send a package every timestep or adjust the
    sending frequency to the local :math:`dt`).

    The logic described in text here, can be expressed as an inequality for
    when to use a packet: :math:`t - dt/2 <= t' < t + dt/2`. In the `recv`
    method this inequality is split up into two parts. The left part is handled
    by the while loop (because it is a while and not an if condition, the logic
    of the condition gets inverted). The right inequality is handled by the
    following if condition. Note, that we set :math:`dt' = dt` if
    :math:`dt' <= dt` and thus we can use :math:`dt'` instead of :math:`dt`
    which allows us to use exactly the same code for the second case discussed
    next.

    In the second case the top row in the diagram corresponds to the remote
    end.  When receiving data, each local timestep should use the remote value
    from the remote timestep with the largest overlap in the interval (because
    that value will be most representative for the given local timestep). So
    given the picture above, local timesteps 1, 2, 3 should use the remote
    value for timestep 1; 4, 5 the value for 2; 6, 7, 8 the value for 3. Thus,
    the first local timestep that overlaps more than 50% with the next remote
    timestep interval should receive a new packet. Expressed as an equation, if
    :math:`t' + dt'/2 < t` (where :math:`t'` is the last received timestamp),
    a new packet should be received. Note that this is equivalent to the left
    inequality obtained in the first case, so we don't need special handling
    for this case. Also, the right inequality applies. If the received value
    does not fulfil :math:`t' - dt'/2 < t` (where :math:`t'` is now the
    timestep of the newly received packet), it is a value that corresponds to
    timesteps that are still in the future and should not be used yet.

    When sending data, we could send a packet every timestep, but this would
    flood the remote end with packets that it does not use (at least currently
    where only a single value is used and no averaging is done). So, we want
    to send the next packet at the :math:`t` closest to :math:`t' + dt'` (where
    :math:`t'` is the timestamp of the last sent packet). Expressed as an
    equation a packet should be send when :math:`t' + dt' <= t + dt/2`.
