Nengo FPGA is an extension of `Nengo <https://github.com/nengo/nengo>`_
that allows portions of a network to be run on an FPGA to improve performance
and efficiency.

Currently Nengo FPGA supports the Xilinx PYNQ board from Digilent  and the Intel Altera DE1 SoC from Terasic. Each has a slightly different implementation but Nengo FPGA provides a unified frontend for both devices.
